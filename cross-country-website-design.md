## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `races` - Race events, divisions and metadata including date, location,
- `results` - Race results with individual names, time, individual place and team place
- `athletes` - Runner information and details
- `teams` - Team information with school, race year

### Key Relationships
- Teams participate in multiple races per season
- Athletes belong to teams
- Results link athletes to races

## User Roles

- View race results and statistics
- Access athlete profiles and team information

## Key Pages

### 1. Home Dashboard
- List Recently imported races
- Search for Individual runners
- Search for Team pages
- Create/Import Races and Results
- If logged in admin, link to admin pages

### 2. Individual Results
- Name, school, grade of runner
- personal best time, time trend
- table of race results: date, meet, division, individual place, quintile, time, time vs best, time vs previous
- 3D distribution chart of division times, highlighting individual among division bell curve.

### 3. Team Results
- Name of school
- table of race results sorted by date then runners by team place
- 3D distribution chart of race bell curve with highlights for team individuals

### 4. Admin / Import data
